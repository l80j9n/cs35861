We   acknowledge   that   we   are   on   the   treaty   lands   and   territory   of   the   Mississaugas   of   the   Credit   First   Nation and   pay   tribute   to   their   legacy   and   the   legacy   of   all   First   Peoples   of   Canada,   as   we   strengthen   ties   with the   communities we   serve   and   build   the future   through   learning   and   through   our   graduates.   Today   the   traditional   meeting   place of Toronto   is still   home to   many   Indigenous   People from across Turtle   Island and we   are   grateful   to   have the   opportunity   to   work   in   the   communities   that   have   grown   in   the   treaty   lands   of the   Mississaugas. We acknowledge that we are all treaty   people   and   accept   our   responsibility to   honor   all   our   relations.
